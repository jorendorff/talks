The greatest joy in programming, for me, is how it ruthlessly joins the
practical and pure philosophy. Plato inquired into the fundamental
nature of things and found that the material things around us are mere
grubby imitations of the Forms, which are pure, idealized, timeless,
conceptual objects. Looking around you, you can find any number of
rectangular things, every one of them covered in dingy spots and dents
and scratches and microscopic imperfections and stickers. They are not
perfect rectangles. They are imitations of a form.

Plato was the first proponent of prototypal inheritance, like in
JavaScript.

Which is a joke, but of course the programs we write really do contain
all sorts of objects that, like the Forms, are idealized, conceptual
versions of real-world things. On the left here, a User object. On the
right, a user.

(the user ideally is giving us the middle finger)

We are the engineers of Plato's Forms. We have touched ideas that the
ancients would have thrilled and despaired to know about. What a time to
be alive.
