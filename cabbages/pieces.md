And there's another thing.
Different programming languages pose different side quests for the programmer, right?
Inform offers the challenge of writing a description that does the job,
and also reads as smooth, clean English prose.
This pushes all my buttons. I love it.

Alloy *feels* simple, but it's

* classes and subclassing
* relations
* operators on relations (`^`, `~`, `*`)
* the amazing dot operator (`.`)
* set operations (`+`, `-`, `&`, `in`, `no`, `some`, `one`, `lone`)
* keywords that tell about the number of things in sets (some, one, lone, no, set)

* models and instances
* logic
* quantification (all, no, some, lone, one)
* `check` vs. `run`
* `fact` vs. `assert`
* `pred` and how to combine predicates
* functions and how they work
